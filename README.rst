CPython Patches
===============

This project is an unofficial fork of `CPython <https://github.com/python/cpython>`_ sources used as
staging area to maintain and test CPython patches.

Fixes and improvements to CPython should first be contributed upstream. The
`Python Developerâ€™s Guide <https://docs.python.org/devguide/>`_ is a great
resource to guide you through the process.

That said, there are few scenarios where maintaining CPython patches is relevant:

* When there is a need for a staging area for patches waiting to be integrated
  upstream. Doing so avoid each project to maintain their own set of patches.

* When the proposed patches are specific to a system not officially supported
  (e.g Android, Emscripten, ...).

* When generalizing proposed patches is definitively not feasible given the
  time and resources.

* When patches fix an older version of CPython (e.g. 2.7) so that it can
  be compiled using newer compiler (e.g VS2015).
